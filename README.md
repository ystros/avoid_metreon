# AvoidMetreon

A simple generator that looks up the schedule for events at Moscone Center and
generates a page warning whether to expect the surrounding areas (Metreon,
Yerba Buena, etc) to be crowded.

## Really?

Look, I decided to go to the area not realizing Dreamforce was going on. Then
I did it again during Oracle World. A bad time was had.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'avoid_metreon'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install avoid_metreon

## Usage

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
